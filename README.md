# Tri-Health-Predictor

https://ambarcode-tri-health-predictor-trihealth-3ffata.streamlit.app/


Welcome to Tri Health Predictor! This web application is designed to predict three common diseases: diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease. It uses machine learning algorithms to make these predictions.

# Algorithms used

The following algorithms were used to build the models for each disease:

Diabetes Prediction: SVM Classifier

Heart Disease Prediction: Logistic Regression

Parkinson's Prediction: SVM


The reason for using these specific algorithms is that they are commonly used for predicting these diseases and have shown to produce good results. However, it's important to note that these are some very basic models and there is always room for improvement.


# Deployment


Tri Health Predictor has been deployed using Streamlit Cloud. This allows the web application to be easily accessed and used by anyone with an internet connection.


#How to use



To use Tri Health Predictor, simply navigate to the deployed web application and select the disease you would like to predict. Then, fill out the required information such as age, gender, blood pressure, etc. and click the "Predict" button. The application will then use the appropriate machine learning model to make a prediction based on the inputted information.



It's important to note that the predictions made by Tri Health Predictor should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice. The purpose of this application is to provide an initial indication of a potential health issue and should not be used for self-diagnosis or self-treatment.



# Future improvements


As mentioned before, these are some very basic models and there is always room for improvement. In the future, more complex machine learning algorithms could be used to improve the accuracy of the predictions. Additionally, more data could be collected to make the models more robust and accurate.



Thank you for using Tri Health Predictor!
